### Step 3

**Set up development environment**

Look under documents in each project's section for setup instruction. It is our goal that each project have a detailed instruction, a installation script, or even a VirtualBox image prepared for you. 

If you get stuck - ask questions on the relevant slack channel, ask people to join you in a PP (PairProgramming) session and guide you or propose changes to the setup documents (this way, we will not forget about the encountered problem and add the solution to the document)
