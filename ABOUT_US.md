## About Us

**AgileVentures is an official UK Charity dedicated to crowdsourced learning and social coding. As a charitable organization, we are committed to providing training for those who need it the most, but also empower them to share their skills with others, and use them for a good cause.** 

We follow the Agile approach to software development, and practice social coding using remote pair programming technologies such as Google Meet. Anyone at any skill level can participate or simply observe in the remote pair programming sessions and planning meetings as we develop solutions for real customers in the non-profit sector. There are no minimum requirements, simply an interest to learn.

We have meetings and pair programming sessions every day with participants from all time zones and on all levels. **Be on a lookout in Slack and feel free to join to contribute, or just say hello and hear about what's going on :-)**
