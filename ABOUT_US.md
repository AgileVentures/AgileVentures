## About Us

**AgileVentures is an official UK Charity dedicated to crowdsourced learning and social coding. As a charitable organization, we are committed to providing training for those who need it the most, but also empower them to share their skills with others, and use them for a good cause.** 

We follow the Agile approach to software development, and practice social coding using remote pair programming technologies such as Google Meet or Zoom. You can also join our community streams on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/agileventures). Anyone at any skill level can participate or simply observe in the remote pair programming sessions and planning meetings as we develop solutions for real customers in the non-profit sector. There are no minimum requirements, simply an interest to learn.

We have meetings and pair programming sessions every day with participants from all time zones and on all levels. **Be on a lookout in Slack and feel free to join to contribute, or just say hello and hear about what's going on :-)**

### Crowdsourced Learning with AgileVentures
_July 9th, 2021_

**The Community Sourced Traing Program Work The Web - Summer Camp 2021 is under way!**

Our training program Work The Web kicked off with the first session on Tuesday, June 6th. During the first week of sessions,  we covered some pretty theory-heavy topics related to the very foundations of the web and web-based applications, and we are happy to see a lot of engagement from the community. 

We stand stand ready to move on to some more practical parts of the course that will involve planning and building a small system in NodeJS and ReactJS. Along the way, we will look into the basics of Agile methodologies for planning and executing projects and some sound software engineering practices like pair programming, making use of version control, and writing automated tests. 

We meet up several times a week - Tuesdays and Thursdays for instructor-led theory and practice sessions, and Saturday and Sunday for support sessions and mob-programming workshops. See our events calendar for details. 

If you want to audit the course, please join the #work_the_web_2021 channel on Slack. Not a member? <a href="https://www.agileventures.org/users/sign_up">Sign up</a> and gain access for free
