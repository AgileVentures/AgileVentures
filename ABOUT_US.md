## About Us

**AgileVentures is an official UK Charity dedicated to crowdsourced learning and social coding. As a charitable organization, we are committed to providing training for those who need it the most, but also empower them to share their skills with others, and use them for a good cause.** 

We follow the Agile approach to software development, and practice social coding using remote pair programming technologies such as Google Meet. Anyone at any skill level can participate or simply observe in the remote pair programming sessions and planning meetings as we develop solutions for real customers in the non-profit sector. There are no minimum requirements, simply an interest to learn.

We have meetings and pair programming sessions every day with participants from all time zones and on all levels. **Be on a lookout in Slack and feel free to join to contribute, or just say hello and hear about what's going on :-)**

# Community news

## New Community Courses

Our mission is to make software development more accessible to whoever want to learn and work toward high and ambitios goals. Apart from another run of the highly appreciated WorkTheWeb Taining Program, we are proud to announce 2 new Community Courses that will help you level up as a developer.

### Just Enough JavaScript To get Started In Web Development

Yes, that is the longest course title ever, but the content of this cCommunity Course is focused on short and concise overview of JavaScript - one of the cornerstones of the technologies that power the web. 

### E2E Testing With CypressIO - From Almost Zero To Hero(ish) Level

Cypress is a cutting-edge framework that makes writing automated tests for front-end applications mostly frictionless. This course is a rapid introduction to Cypress.io, covering basic and intermediate techniques for writing end-to-end test cases. Throughout this course, you'll learn how to write test cases that simulate different interactions between your end-users and your application. 

This course is for anyone who wants to learn how to work with Cypress and properly use this new tool to incorporate automated testing in their development flow.

**These courses are for reserved for Community Members only. Start Date will be announced on Slack.**
