## Learn With AgileVentures - Summer Camp 2021

_May 27th, 2021_

The mission of our community is twofold: to provide members with learning opportunities and to help other charities and NGO's develop their IT infrastructure.

We believe that the best way to learn is to work on the practical implementation of software-based in solutions. We want to move beyond tutorials and self-paced training offerings. We want to help our members develop skills that will lead them to a brighter future.

**We are happy to announce our latest initiative: A 9-week long instructor-led training program on Web-technologies offered to a selected group of 10 students as active participants and streamed on Twitch for other community members and the general public as self-paced training. The curriculum will be based on professional training courses delivered pro-bono by trainers from the IT industry.**

The 10 participants will be selected among the community volunteers through an application process. 

Together, we'll learn about Agile Methodologies, Software as a Service, Back-end development, and Front-end application development. We will also cover testing and best practices.
