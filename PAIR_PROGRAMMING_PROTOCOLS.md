### App Academy Pair Programming Protocol:

- new pair every day
- 15 minute timer driver navigator swap
    - dual keyboard setup to make swapping easier
    - only driver has control of the computer
- bite sized projects in morning, bigger projects in the afternoon
- capstone projects are individual
    - they say that learning phase is best for pairing - when later repeating for practise then pairing allegedly not so helpful
- TDD/BDD is not required --> focused on javascript for preference
