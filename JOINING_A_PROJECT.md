Joining a Project
-----------------

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Naturally pull down the code and see if you can run the tests and app locally.  Don't suffer in silence; if you get stuck on any part of install, or deployment then ask for help in the slack chat room for the project, or open a github issue.

Having joined the slack channel for the relevant project, we encourage you to read everything that is taking place there, and joining in any [asynchronous voting](https://github.com/AgileVentures/AgileVentures/blob/master/ASYNC_VOTING.md) that takes place there.  Say hello in the chat and ask if there is any way you could help.

Also, do join any open scrum/standup (hangout) that you see and say hi, ask if there is anything interested to work on.  Scrums are also pair hookup sessions where the scrum master will try and hook you up with a pair partner if you want one.

It certainly doesn't hurt to read all the documentation associated with the project, in particular the user stories in any feature tests.  

One of the key things is to try and make contact with the "project managers" for each project.  Here are some of the PMs for recently active projects:

* [LocalSupport](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/localsupport/) - Sam Joseph (tansaku)
* [MetPlus](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/metplus/) - João Pereira (and Pat Bolger)
* [WebSiteOne](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/websiteone/) - Raoulo Diffouo (and Sam Joseph)
* [OSRA](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/osra/) - Nikita Avvakumov
* [SHF](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/shf-project/) - Susanna Larsdotter
* [AsyncVoter](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/async_voter/) - Sam Joseph (and João Pereira)
* [Redeemify](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/redeemify/) - Matt Lindsey (and Armando Fox)
* [ProjectScope](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/projectscope/) - Michael C (and Sam Joseph)
* [DDA pallet](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/dda-pallet/) - Michael Jerger
* [VisitMeet](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/visitmeet/) - Bishisht Bhatta

A great way to get oriented to a project is to ask for an overview session with the project manager.
Since the Agile Ventures staffing model relies primarily on volunteers, team compositions tend to be fluid
as people come and go.  As a result, projects need to "on-board" new members quite often.

If you're not receiving responses in a project channel, try adding @tansaku (or appropriate PM slack name tag) to your message in that channel, to highlight that you need help moving forward.

We also recommend reading over any pull requests that the project has open.  You don't have to comment, but you can get a lot from just reading the pull requests, seeing what issues they are trying to address, looking at the code changes.  If you're up for it please do make comments in the pull requests and join the discussion about the changes being made.

Not much time to spare?
----------------------

* <15 minutes to spare?  Review a pull request, vote on a ticket, or even start a new vote
* <30 minutes to spare? join a scrum and say hi, give us an update on what you're doing, read a project's documentation; observe a pairing session
* <60 minutes to spare? Start getting set up with a code base for a new project
* <90 minutes to spare? Start working on a ticket, join a pairing session
