This is a heatmap of the distribution of students taking the edX CS 169 Software as a Service course who responded to a survey on remote pair programming.

Here is the same heatmap but weighted as a function of self reported hours per week spent remote pair programming by those students.

And again the same heatmap but this time weighted as a function of self reported number of remote pair programming sessions attended by these students.
