### 2.2.1 Cookies

This video has some problems with the audio, and also it's not recorded in the VM, so the web developer tools are not in the same places as for students using the VM.  Also seems like the web developer toolbar extension is now not in the VM FF by default.

Always found it funny to talk about HTML and HTTP without any mention of Tim Berners Lee, but then again it's pretty strange to talk about Rails without talking about DHH.
