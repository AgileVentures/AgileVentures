The "Contacts" column contains the "Slack name" of one or more people that can help orient you to the project.  

Use this name to alert that person to a specific message when you post to the project slack channel.  For example, say you want to post a message to the MetPlus project channel, and make sure that "patrick" is aware of that message.  Here, you would go to the channel (and join the channel), and send a message like this:

"@patrick - hi, I am new to agile ventures and I would like to learn more about this project."

"patrick" will then be alerted to your message and respond back.
