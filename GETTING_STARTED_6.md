# Getting Started 6 (of 7)

### Step 6

**Start contributing.**

**We are a PairProgramming community.** Pair Programming is our passion and we strongly believe that is an **efficient way to learn and code and develop good software**.  However we are very happy to receive solo contributions when you are starting on a project.

If you'd like **to setup a Pair Programming session** - either create an event at http://agileventures.org/events with a category PairProgramming or click "Start hangout" button on the individual project's page. 

An automatic announcement will be made on slack channel #pairing_notifications (although this currently requires a manual update since Google retired their Hangout API).

Click 'Start Broadcast' when Hangout loads - this way, the recording will be stored at your YouTube channel and gets listed on individual project's page (this also now requires a manual update...).
