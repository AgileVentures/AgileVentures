### AgileVentures goes live on Twitch!

_June 8th, 2021_

Streaming has been an integrated part of the AgileVentures process since its inception. Most of the Scrums and Pair Programming sessions of the early days of the community were streamed to YouTube and contributed significantly to community engagement. The AgileVentures community was a pioneer in bringing live coding and project work live on the internet. 

Over the recent years, live streaming has become more and more mainstream, and co-working and co-study groups have gained a lot of popularity and could be a way to potentially expand the member and volunteer base of Agile Ventures. We believe that live streaming technical sessions can play a vital role in developing engagement among community members. All developers suffer some form of imposter syndrome at some time, and being a beginner programmer makes it worse. Joining a live session (like on Google Meet or Jitsy) is a threshold that can be off-putting and can hinder individual members to start participating in community events. Streaming, on the other hand, is more passive and can be perceived as a way to ease in into live coding. Viewers can only participate over chat, and if they don't want to interact with the host, they can stay in the background and lurk.

We have a vision of an AgileVentures Team on Twitch.tv where our members and Community Organizers can organize co-working and co-study groups. The number of co-study/co-working streamers has increased dramatically over the last few months and co-working is likely to become a very popular niche on Twitch.

The first step in going live on Twitch is happening as you are reading this. You can find our [community channel](https://www.twitch.tv/agileventures) at Twitch and we have two of our members stream live coding on a regular basis. 

* [Arc_Anya](https://www.twitch.tv/arc_anya) streams co-working sessions on most weekdays and is part of our community sponsorship
* [Verena](https://twitch.tv/novas1r1) is a programmer with focus on mobile application development using Flutter and is part of our community sponsorship
* [Thomas Ochman](https://www.twitch.tv/thomas_ochman) is streaming AV Community Follow-ups and Q&A sessions and quite a lot of his own personal coding. 
* [AgileVentures](https://www.twitch.tv/agileventures) is the channel where we will stream more community events in the upcoming months.

**Check out these streamers and become a part of the movement of Live, Social Coding. If you are considering setting up your own channel on Twitch, please reach out to us and we are more than happy to help!**

_April 29th, 2021_

AgileVentures has appointed  Mr. Thomas Ochman as its next chief executive. 
 
Mr. Ochman is a senior developer and tech-entrepreneur with a focus on education, project management, and agile methodologies. He is currently running a training and education start-up in Sweden. His expertise in education and re-skilling projects will add to the mix of charitable activities AgileVentures offers to live up to its mission; to promote advancement of education of the general public as well as efficiency and effectiveness of other Third Sector organizations, by providing affordable software development and project management.
 
Bryan Yap, Chair of the Board of Trustees of AgileVentures, states: "The landscape of software development and learning is changing rapidly.  Thomas's appointment to the role as Chief Executive is a clear indication of our intention to ensure that we as a charity can help to further democratize technical education, and help our organization in these pivotal times."
 
"Access to educational resources online has opened up tremendous opportunities for career advancement among students, especially those with disadvantaged backgrounds. We recognize that there is a widespread demand for learning in a social context that focuses not only on theoretical skills but also on practical project work", Bryan Yap continues.
 
"Commitment to Open Source but also to what we call Open Learning, has been an integrated part of the AgileVentures process since inception. As an organization, we are committed to providing training for those who need it the most, but to also empower them to share their skills with others, and use them for a good cause.", says Thomas Ochman and adds "I plan to expand on that by organizing community events, forming partnerships with key players in the industry, and increase our outreach among groups underrepresented in tech"

Thomas is a long time volunteer with Agileventures and one of the initial forces behind various initiatives of the charity. He joined the initial group of learners that AgileVentures former Chief Executive Samuel Joseph formed, to work on charity projects and develop the community of people around the world that shared commitment to Open Source Software.
