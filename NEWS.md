_April 29th, 2021_

AgileVentures has appointed  Mr. Thomas Ochman as its next chief executive. 
 
Mr. Ochman is a senior developer and tech-entrepreneur with a focus on education, project management, and agile methodologies. He is currently running a training and education start-up in Sweden. His expertise in education and re-skilling projects will add to the mix of charitable activities AgileVentures offers to live up to its mission; to promote advancement of education of the general public as well as efficiency and effectiveness of other Third Sector organizations, by providing affordable software development and project management.
 
Bryan Yap, Chair of the Board of Trustees of AgileVentures, states: "The landscape of software development and learning is changing rapidly.  Thomas's appointment to the role as Chief Executive is a clear indication of our intention to ensure that we as a charity can help to further democratize technical education, and help our organization in these pivotal times."
 
"Access to educational resources online has opened up tremendous opportunities for career advancement among students, especially those with disadvantaged backgrounds. We recognize that there is a widespread demand for learning in a social context that focuses not only on theoretical skills but also on practical project work", Bryan Yap continues.
 
"Commitment to Open Source but also to what we call Open Learning, has been an integrated part of the AgileVentures process since inception. As an organization, we are committed to providing training for those who need it the most, but to also empower them to share their skills with others, and use them for a good cause.", says Thomas Ochman and adds "I plan to expand on that by organizing community events, forming partnerships with key players in the industry, and increase our outreach among groups underrepresented in tech"

Thomas is a long time volunteer with Agileventures and one of the initial forces behind various initiatives of the charity. He joined the initial group of learners that AgileVentures former Chief Executive Samuel Joseph formed, to work on charity projects and develop the community of people around the world that shared commitment to Open Source Software.
