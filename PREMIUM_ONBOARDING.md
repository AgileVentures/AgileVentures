New Premium Member Sign Up
==========================

Creating Private Premium Channel
--------------------------------

e.g. premium_annie (+ surname if necessary)

and post the following:

> hi @<slack-tag> - this is your private premium support channel - I'm here as your mentor, but others may join later :slightly_smiling_face:

> Here's a list of all your Premium benefits:

```
* Access to AgileVentures' private Premium Slack channels (#professional_develop, #jobs, #tech_tests etc.)
* Professional Code Review
* Eligibility to work on paid projects
* Support on any questions you post to StackOverflow
* CodeSchool NonProfit Discount ($10 a month saving)
```
> I'll add you now to #professional_develop - just let me know if you want access to #tech_tests #jobs #jobs_feed #devops #paid_projects or any others that we have


Editing as appropriate

Adding to Channels
------------------

Depending on your discussion with the new member, you may want to immediately to add them to all the private channels, but the only requirement is to add them to #professional_develop - they may or may not be interested in the others ...

Help messages after Adding to a Channel
---------------------------------------

It may help the new member to let them know a little about the channel they've just joined (even in the channel where it might help remind others of the channel purpose), like so:

> @name this channel has all the AV mentors, and all members who are Premium and above; and it's for any questions about Premium or professional development in general :-)

> please feel free to introduce yourself or just hang out and listen - it's all good :-)

Checking User Represented Correctly on Site
-------------------------------------------
