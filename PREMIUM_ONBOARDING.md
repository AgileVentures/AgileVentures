> hi @<slack-tag> - this is your private premium support channel - I'm here as your mentor, but others may join later :slightly_smiling_face:

> Here's a list of all your Premium benefits:

```

* Professional Code Review
* Eligibility to work on paid projects
* Support on any questions you post to StackOverflow
* CodeSchool NonProfit Discount ($10 a month saving)
```
> I'll add you now to #professional_develop - just let me know if you want access to #tech_tests #jobs #jobs_feed #devops #paid_projects or any others that we have


Editing as appropriate

Adding to Channels
------------------

Depending on your discussion with the new member, you may want to immediately to add them to all the private channels, but the only requirement is to add them to #professional_develop - they may or may not be interested in the others ...
