New Premium Member Sign Up
==========================

Creating Private Premium Channel
--------------------------------

e.g. premium_annie (+ surname if necessary)

and post the following:

> hi @<slack-tag> - this is your private premium support channel - I'm here as your mentor, but others may join later :slightly_smiling_face:

> Here's a list of all your Premium benefits:

```
* Access to AgileVentures' private Premium Slack channels (#professional_develop, #jobs, #tech_tests etc.)
* Professional Code Review
* Eligibility to work on paid projects
* Support on any questions you post to StackOverflow
* CodeSchool NonProfit Discount ($10 a month saving)
```
> I'll add you now to #professional_develop - just let me know if you want access to #tech_tests #jobs #jobs_feed #devops #paid_projects or any others that we have


Editing as appropriate

Adding to Channels
------------------

Depending on your discussion with the new member, you may want to immediately to add them to all the private channels, but the only requirement is to add them to #professional_develop - they may or may not be interested in the others ...

Help messages after Adding to a Channel
---------------------------------------

It may help the new member to let them know a little about the channel they've just joined (even in the channel where it might help remind others of the channel purpose), like so:

> @name this channel has all the AV mentors, and all members who are Premium and above; and it's for any questions about Premium or professional development in general :-)

> please feel free to introduce yourself or just hang out and listen - it's all good :-)

Checking User Represented Correctly on Site
-------------------------------------------

Assuming the sign up process has gone off correctly, the new member should be visible in the list of Premium members:

New Premium Mob Member Sign Up
==============================

If the person has signed up for Premium Mob all the above procedure is still followed, but we also add the person to the #premium_extra channel and explain its purpose:

> @name this channel has all Premium Mob members and above and all the links to the hangouts and videos for the different mobs get posted here

and post the list of mob benefits to their private premium channel:

> also, here's a list of your premium mob benefits:

```
* Mob programming sessions with an assigned AV Mentor each week
* Professional Development Planning Support
* Free accesss to Udemy Complete Elixir & Phoenix Bootcamp course
* Free accesss to Udemy React Redux course 
* 25% discount on "Effective Testing with RSpec 3"
* 10% discount on Upcase membership
* Free access to the "Phoenix Inside Out" book series
```

> don't hesitate to ask if there's anything you need :-)

There's also the option of giving the Premium Mob member access to our youtube account so they can review all previous videos - ultimately we'd like to replace this with having access to the videos through the AV website.
