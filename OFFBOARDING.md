Sometimes folks leave and we need to remove their registration with, or access to, various things, e.g. 

Standuply
--------

* From Slack run `/standuply_login` and then click the Login prompt to be redirected to a web interface to access the relevant report to remove someone from being pinged by Standuply

AV Emails
---------

* Sign into https://admin.google.com/ and navigate to Users where you can suspend a user following these [instructions](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33312?hl=en)
