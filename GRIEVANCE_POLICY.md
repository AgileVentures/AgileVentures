# Grievance Policy

This is the Grievance Policy for the [AgileVentures Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/AgileVentures/AgileVentures/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you feel you have a grievance resulting from the application of the AgileVentures Community Code of Conduct, please email info@agileventures.org detailing your concerns.

We recommend that you include digital copies relating to your grievance, be they a screenshot of a text chat interaction or a video of a pairing session, scrum or other meeting.  If the grievance relates to something on another site such as in GitHub or Pivotal Tracker comments then please do provide a link, but a screenshot is also appreciated in case things are deleted.

Even you do not have a digital copy, please do your best to describe in your grievance in detail and we will do our best to respond as quickly as possible.
