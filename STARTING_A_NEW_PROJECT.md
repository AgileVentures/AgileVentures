Starting a New Project
----------------------

Anybody can start a new project in AgileVentures.  We are strongly committed to open source and open development, and we focus on charity and non-profit projects because the majority of work done in AgileVentures comes from volunteers.  We can consider projects from for-profit enterprises, but we will require a strong committment to open source and open development.

If you want to start a new project please talk to us about it in the [new projects channel](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/new_projects) on our AV slack instance.  You can also create a project page on the AgileVentures site itself by going to http://www.agileventures.org/projects/new

We can also set up a dedicated project channel for you on slack.  See some of the existing active project channels for examples of project activity: 

* [LocalSupport](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/localsupport/)
* [WebSiteOne](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/websiteone/)
* [MetPlus](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/metplus/)
* [AsyncVoter](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/async_voter/)

The slack channels are used to discuss the project in general, for members to get help with technical issues and also to vote on estimating how difficult it will be to complete those stories.  Depending on the project, team members may coordinate their activities and vote on stories in real time in online "scrums".  These take place in Google Hangouts, and you can see the regular times of these scrums in our [About Us page](http://www.agileventures.org/about-us).  They are also advertised with a count-down on the site, and everyone is always welcome.  Simple pop in to observe how things work, ask questions, or even watch the live stream and recordings on YouTube.

Several projects are now also using Asychronous Voting to estimate stories, see more info on that in [ASYNC_VOTING.md](ASYNC_VOTING.md).  For an overview of how Agile projects work in general, please watch this video:
