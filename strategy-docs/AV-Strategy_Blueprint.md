AgileVentures Strategy Blueprint
===

There are many different ways to craft, solidify, and focus the vision and strategy for an organization.  Sometimes it's easier to work from more general ideas and then develop the tangible from them.  Sometimes it's easier to identify the tangible and then identify the overarching themes.  Usually its a process that involves going back and forth between both.

Below are 2 main sections: _1. Strategic Blueprint_, and _2. Goals, Actors, and Impacts._  The _Strategic Blueprint_ is a series of questions to help you think about and fully describe AgileVentures at a high level.  Section 2 takes those ideas and begins to make them more tactical; it begins to develop measureable actions and artifacts. (There will be overlap, and that's OK.)   Ultimately you want to have both sections filled out because that will provide you with a thorough vision and strategy, and it will express it through different perspectives and facets.

#1. Strategic Blueprint

_(based on work by Jim Kalbach)_

Strategy is the high level vision that is used to craft plans, roadmaps, and actions.  
#### Strategy is how your organization makes sense of actions and decisions over time.
Your strategy informs your priorities and choices.

##Aspirations
- What kind of organization do you want to be?  

- What kind of culture do you want to have internally?

- When your customers/clients think of you, what do you want them to think? 


- What are your aspirations for your customers/clients? What do you want to achieve with them?


- What are your aspirations for society?



##Focus Areas
- What is your scope? 

- Who will you serve?

  _(Developers (novice, experienced, mentors); non-profits; sponsors; the software development community at large)_

- What domain(s)?

  _(agile software development.  Focused on web software?)_

- What geographic regions?



##Guiding Principles
- What principles will unite your team(s) and unify decision making?

- What will guide your teams toward success in the right way?

- What are the keys to overcoming your challenges?

##Challenges
- What problems are you trying to solve?

- What obstacles must you overcome?

- What opposing forces must you overcome to reach your goals?

- Strategy implies change from A to B.  What are the hurdles to doing so?


##Risks

- What are the critical dependencies that are out of your control?

- What are the major unknowns?

- What would threaten the existence or sustainability of AgileVentures?




##Abilities
- What are the skills and capabilities you already have so you can implement this and achieve your aspirations?

- What are the skills and capabilities you need to implement this and achieve your aspirations?


##Outcomes
- How will you know if your strategy is on track?

- How will you know youâ€™re off track? 

- How will you measure success?

- How will you recognize pain points?



##Sustainability: Surviving Short- and Long-term
What are the major ways AgileVentures is funded?  What are the other major resources needed and where do they come from?



===========



Given your answers to the questions above, can you now write a succinct, focused statement that describes the AgileVentures vision?

## Vision
Write a 2 to 3 sentence explanation of why AgileVenturs exists:  What is AgileVentures trying to achieve? Why is that important?

#2. Goals, Actors, and Impacts



## Main _Goals_


These are high level, overarching goals. Goals are ways of addressing _how_ you are going to achieve your vision.  They start to make the vision more specific (break it down into its major parts) and tangible. Goals have some way of being assessed; they are measureable in some way, and sometimes have a 'finish line'.  (Thus "being successful" is not a goal because it doesn't include anything about how it can be measured.)  Your answer to **Outcomes** above should inform (and overlap) these main goals.





## Actors: _Whom_ do you want to affect?

#### 1. Developers
- novice developers

- more experienced developers

- mentors (highly skilled developers that also have teaching/mentoring skills)

#### 2. Non-Profits

#### 3. Sponsors

#### 4. The software development community






## Impact: Affecting Actors

####In order to Acheive Your _Goals_, What _Impact_ must you have on each of the _Actors_?

Impacts are some sort of **change:** cheaper, faster, stronger, fewer errors, more money, better-looking, etc.  Because _impacts_ serve a goal, they are **measurable.**



*: Defining what solution you're providing and what pain you're relieving is also known as a _"value proposition"_, as in "Here is our value proposition for novice developers:  We are providing them with more than just another open source project to flail away at, we offer them mentoring at various price-points, from working in small groups with an expert to highly focused, individual sessions; a supportive community that is moderated so that it maintains a culture of support and inclusion, ...."  This is a way of _proposing_ to an **actor** that you are going to **impact** them in some way.
