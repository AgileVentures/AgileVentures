AgileVentures Strategy Blueprint
===

There are many different ways to craft, solidify, and focus the vision and strategy for an organization.  Sometimes it's easier to work from more general ideas and then develop the tangible from them.  Sometimes it's easier to identify the tangible and then identify the overarching themes.  Usually its a process that involves going back and forth between both.  The two approaches can parallel the "Outside In" and "Inside Out" approaches to system development.

Below are 2 main sections in this document: _1. Strategic Blueprint_, and _2. Goals, Actors, and Impacts._  The _Strategic Blueprint_ is a series of questions to help you think about and fully describe an undertaking at a high level.  Section 2 takes those ideas and begins to make them more tactical; it begins to develop measureable actions and artifacts. (There will be overlap, and that's OK.)   Ultimately you want to have both sections filled out because that will provide you with a thorough vision and strategy, and it will express it through different perspectives and facets.

#1. Strategic Blueprint

_(based on work by Jim Kalbach)_

Strategy is the high level vision that is used to craft plans, roadmaps, and actions.  
#### Strategy is how your organization makes sense of actions and decisions over time.
Your strategy informs your priorities and choices.

##Aspirations
- What kind of organization do you want to be?

AgileVentures aspires to be an organization that is open to all, and is transparent in its operation.  Educational establishments around the world are characterised by gateways that allow in some and not others.  They are subject to ideas about secrecy in the student teacher relationship, and make heavy use of toy and abstract study material with varying degrees of relation to the world outside academia.  AgileVentures does not want to force anyone to make anything public they are not comfortable with, but proposes being accessible to everyone in exchange for openness in the learning the process. There is also a commitment to ensuring that learning is in a real-world context; learning through building systems that serve a purpose for others besides just the learners and mentors.  We seek to link the educational process to the greater good around the world; helping deserving charities and non-profits around the world tackle their technology and organisational challenges.

As an organisation AgileVentures aspires to provide a support infrastructure around lots of autonomous learning project teams. The teams should feel empowered to develop their own process, while the broaded organisation seeks to help those teams insure those processes are inclusive and open.  AgileVentures aspires to empower individuals, and groups and avoid arduous bureaucracy by inspiring every individual and group to the higher goals of open, 'in-context' education for all. 

- What kind of culture do you want to have internally?

We'd like to feel that individuals enjoy participating in AgileVentures culture.  The nature of humans is that there will be conflicts about process, technology choices, communication.  We'd like everyone to by polite and considerate of others, but also feel able to say the things that are important to them.   We want everyone to feel empowered to say things in the different AgileVentures forums, but also to be aware that sometimes even a polite question can be incendiary under certain conditions.  Everyone is fighting a hard battle.  There is always room for compromise on both sides.  Sometimes the process of resolving an issue in an open forum can be intimidating or off-putting for others.  However no one is compelled to participate in any project.  Sometimes it's best to step away and write up your thoughts.  Sometimes it's best to talk to a smaller number of folks in a different forum, and sometimes things do need to be resolved in the open.   Ultimately there is the rule of two-feet; if you're not enjoying working with a particular team or project you can join another or form your own and work on moulding the team culture more to your liking.  The overarching cultural goal of AgileVentures is to be a supportative presence to the various team's individual cultures, provide help and support in resolving conflicts and guidance on forming new teams and projects when that's what's needed.

- When your customers/clients think of you, what do you want them to think? 

We'd like to think that our customers/clients are thinking we are working to the greater good.  That we are not-profited oriented.  That we have no share-holders.  That we are an education charity dedicated to learning, and particularly to open 'in-context' learning that is beyond pure academic or abstract limits.  That we are trying to empower those nervous about their knowledge and skills, that it is okay not to know things, or to make mistakes, and that this is the process of learning at every level.  We want all the individual learners to feel that we are supporting them at their own pace, and feel a very gentle pressure to step up to the next level of challenge and openness in one's own learning process.  For the larger organisations we work with we'd like them to understand all the above, and also to think of us as honest, hard-working, dedicated and professional; giving them honest feedback about their own organisations technological and process challenges.


- What are your aspirations for your customers/clients? What do you want to achieve with them?

We'd like every participant in AgileVentures (whether individual or organisation) to feel empowered to achieve their dreams in terms of skills developed, systems created, challenges solved.  We want to be a learning partner.  An ear; a shoulder to cry on.  We want to be a supportative friend who can tell you the things that might be difficult to hear, but ultimately someone who is with your for the long run, for the whole process, to help you get to whatever level you want to get to.

- What are your aspirations for society?

We aspire to empower those who are trying to help the under-privileged and under-resourced.  We want to support an open social dialogue, but not just be all about talk.  We want to help the process where groups can communicate about issues, and then move to taking necessary actions.

#2. Goals, Actors, and Impacts



## Main _Goals_


These are high level, overarching goals. Goals are ways of addressing _how_ you are going to achieve your vision.  They start to make the vision more specific (break it down into its major parts) and tangible. Goals have some way of being assessed; they are measureable in some way, and sometimes have a 'finish line'.  (Thus "being successful" is not a goal because it doesn't include anything about how it can be measured.)  Your answer to **Outcomes** above should inform (and overlap) these main goals.





## Actors: _Whom_ do you want to affect?

#### 1. Developers
- novice developers

- more experienced developers

- mentors (highly skilled developers that also have teaching/mentoring skills)

#### 2. Non-Profits

#### 3. Sponsors

#### 4. The software development community






## Impact: Affecting Actors

####In order to Acheive Your _Goals_, What _Impact_ must you have on each of the _Actors_?

Impacts are some sort of **change:** cheaper, faster, stronger, fewer errors, more money, better-looking, etc.  Because _impacts_ serve a goal, they are **measurable.**



*: Defining what solution you're providing and what pain you're relieving is also known as a _"value proposition"_, as in "Here is our value proposition for novice developers:  We are providing them with more than just another open source project to flail away at, we offer them mentoring at various price-points, from working in small groups with an expert to highly focused, individual sessions; a supportive community that is moderated so that it maintains a culture of support and inclusion, ...."  This is a way of _proposing_ to an **actor** that you are going to **impact** them in some way.
