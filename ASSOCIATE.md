## Associate Membership

The main benefit from the Associate plan is to help AgileVentures in its ongoing mission to support charities around the world with IT solutions and also make learning resources available globally to developers trying to level up and make the world a better place.  We have to pay for server hosting etc. and every little helps cover our costs.

You can take part in most of AgileVentures activities without paying a membership fee. Associate membership is totally optional and a way of donating to our cause in order to make it sustainable. It does come with some perks though. Apart from supporting our charities mission to help inrease worldwide access to learning resources, and help other NGOs with affordable IT services, Agile Ventures Associate Membership gives the following benefits:

- Ability to hold an official position with Agile Ventures
- Voting rights in Agile Ventures general meetings help decide AV Charity Policy and direction
- Priority access to events, workshops and training sessions.
