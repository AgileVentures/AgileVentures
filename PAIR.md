# Pair

Pair Programming is a method of coding in a pair that leads to improved code quality, team communication, knowledge share and huge learning gains.  Several large scale studies of computer science students have shown improved outcomes when student pair program on coding problems.  

In the past, pair programming has been restricted to those able to meet in the same location, however the ubiquitous nature of the internet has unleashed the remarkable power of remote pair programming, which we strongly encourage everyone to use as part of AgileVentures.

If you want to remote pair program you'll first need to find someone to pair with, for which we recommend joining the AgileVentures Slack Community. Slack is a real-time chat tool that all AgileVenturers use to communicate and coordinate.  You'll get an invite automatically if you [sign up](https://www.agileventures.org/users/sign_up) to join the AgileVentures community.

In the Slack community you can join "channels" for different projects, and see if there's anyone interested in pair programming with you. On Twitch, you can follow along live coding sessions and get inspired.  There's more on this process in our "[getting started](https://www.agileventures.org/getting-started)" pages. 


### Said about Remote Pair Programming

_I've really learned how to use the debugger during these pairing sessions, and we really drive each other forwards :-) It really helps having someone to talk to._ - Dag Andre Ivarson


_I'm convinced that 4 brains is really better than one. I've learned a lot and we go through homework 3 till the end. Thank you all!_ - Antoine Modulo


_Pair programming helped me boost my confidence; it helped me gain a motion from where I'd usually stop. There was socializing, sharing, and a synergistic effect. I've improved a lot!_ - Sunil Manandhar


_When you program alone, if you are stuck, you go spend your time on facebook or theonion.com. But if you pair, you don't get distracted and there is always someone who can give you a hand :)_ - Semyon Vodyannikov
