# Getting Started 5 (of 7)

### Step 5

**Join a standup**. The list of scheduled scrums is here - http://agileventures.org/events but the best resource is usually [the slack #standup_notifications channel](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/scrum_notifications) 

Do not be intimidated - we all came into Standup for the first time at some point and many of us are not native English speakers. Just listen to what people are talking about. Ask questions if you like.

Announce that you would like to work on a specific project and offer to help out in a story.
