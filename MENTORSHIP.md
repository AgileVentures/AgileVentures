# Mentorship

[AgileVentures Mentors](http://www.agileventures.org/mentors) come from many walks of life and backgrounds.  The usual process of becoming a mentor is contributing to one or more AgileVentures' projects over a period that builds up to taking a prominent role in leading the project forward; but other highly skilled individuals may join directly.  Mentors are characterised by great technical, people and communication skills.

AgileVentures Mentors will usually be found in online scrums, meetings and pairing sessions, as well as in Slack helping people in the context of existing AgileVentures projects.  Mentors are also experienced pair programmers who can mob or pair program with [Premium members](http://www.agileventures.org/pricing) to help them improve their pairing style, coding skills and Agile development techniques. 

AgileVentures Mentors don't keep specific virtual office hours, or make any specific time commitment.  It's done on a voluntary basis with support being given over Slack and in occasional teleconferences.  A mentor will usually join one or two private channels with individual Premium members to give them occasional help, advice and encouragement.
