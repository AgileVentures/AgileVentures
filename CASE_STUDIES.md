# Case Studies

## Harrow Community Network

AgileVentures has developed and maintained the Harrow Community Network (HCN) site for the [Voluntary Action Harrow Cooperative](http://voluntaryactionharrow.org.uk/) (VAHC) for the last five years.  The site was developed in Ruby on Rails and can be seen at:

http://www.harrown.org.uk  

The site integrates local volunteer opportunities from multiple external volunteering sites.  It also allows community users to edit their organisation profiles and for admins to collaborate on editing the site's static pages.

The HCN project was started on a volunteer basis and has had an occasional injection of funds to pay for specific development work, for example on the volunteer functionality in the site.  There have been 65 volunteer contributors over the last five years, and a group of six that received payment for their work on the volunteer functionality.  The project management has been done on a voluntary basis by AgileVentures project managers.

Development is sometimes slower than VAHC would like, but new features have been rolled out consistently over the five years of project development.

## NHS HLP Social Prescribing Wiki

NHS Healthy London Partnership (HLP) contracted AgileVentures to build and host a system for social prescribing and self-care in order to foster contributions and sharing of knowledge, resources and experience to the benefit of all Londoners.

Chair and Co-founder Sam Joseph engaged in a series of meetings and phone conversations with NHS HLP staff, G.P.s (doctors), NHS Public Champions, Social Prescribing Service providers, NHS Commissioners and managers as part of a "design sprint" to determine a solution to the challenge of supporting collaborate knowledge share around social prescribing and self-care. That design sprint included usability studies of multiple wiki platforms, and generated a clear vision of what HLP are hoping to achieve. Due to the technical constraints on NHS and Local Authority networks and computers an Azure/Bitnami MediaWiki solution was selected.

NHS Healthy London Partnership paid for the design sprint and testing portions up front, and are paying for 2 years of moderation and maintenance support. The wiki is now live and HLP are happy as various stakeholders are now starting to contribute to the wiki. 

## Wikimedia EDU Dashboard

Wikimedia EDU contracted Agile Ventures charity for the project management of open source volunteer contributions to the Wikimedia edu dashboard. An AgileVentures  project manager ran bi-weekly sprints with daily scrums capped at 15 minutes; hour long kick-off's and retrospectives. Each sprint ran for a total of five 2-week sprints over the course of 10 weeks.  The project pulled in a number of AgileVentures volunteer developers, who developed features as defined by the client.

The dashboard had been developed by a consultancy in Rails and React and is not being run as a volunteer based open source project.

The activity level of the project was at a lower level than hoped, but the client did get 8 pull requests completed over the duration of the project by AgileVentures developers.  The slower pace was due to the nature of staffing projects with unpaid, self-paced volunteers.  However the project did demonstrate that a volunteer staff can produce good results - even over a short time duration - with appropriate agile processes in place and effective project management and volunteer recruitment.

## Michigan Employment and Training System

MetPlus is a non-profit organization that helps job seekers in the State of Michigan, USA to find suitable job opportunities.  The organziation worked with AgileVentures to build a system that could improve the internal workflow of the agency and help the agency to better server their clients. The result of the engagement was a platform that allows job seekers to find and apply to jobs, and enables the organization workers to advise, orient and help their job seekers.

AgileVentures has developed the MetPlus job management system in Ruby on Rails and Java, and hosted on Heroku and AWS. The system is currently in pre-release and MetPlus is starting to work with it, finishing the first milestone of the project.

All the work on the project has been voluntary and the client will be taking out an AgileVentures non-profit maintenance contract once the system goes live. The client has been extremely happy with progress, although for agile development purposes the team would like to have seen the system go into production earlier in the development process.

## Redeemify Coupon Redemption System

Redeemify was first developed at the request of Professor Armando Fox of University of California Berkeley.

It is a system that allows purchasers of the Professor's book to receive 'goodies' like Amazon AWS credit.  It is designed to be a general redemption system that can be re-branded for different clients.

The site was first developed by some of Professor Fox's students, and was recently taken to an MVP version by Agile Ventures members.
