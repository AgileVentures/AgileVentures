Outreach templates
------------------

When reaching out to members individually we usually just say:

> hi there, how is everything going? :-)

and then I often follow up with:

> Is there any way we can help you get more out of AgileVentures?

Another approach is to lead with more text, e.g.

> @kboscar1 Hi Kristen. I’m @federico, an `Outreach Mentor` for AgileVentures. I notice you’ve joined our community for your Software Engineering course that @karmatrinlema runs, and you are working on a project called College Daily, which is really great. :slightly_smiling_face:

> *If there’s anything about AV that you’re not understanding,* like how our pairing sessions work (including our Mob group pairing sessions), *don’t hesitate to reach out and ask me.*

> How has your AV experience been so far?
