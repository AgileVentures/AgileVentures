Volunteer Outreach
==================

We received volunteers through [DoIt](https://do-it.org/) and interns via [Internwise](https://www.internwise.co.uk/).

The [applications page in Do-It](https://do-it.org/users/applications/manage) (only accessible to those granted admin status) shows all the volunteers who have applied.  Depending on the position they are applying for we should send them an email from one of the templates below. IMPORTANT - please ensure that all emails are cc'd to sam@agileventures.org

Once an applicant has emailed we should add the date that we emailed them to the notes in do-it 

(PS: If you are going to directly copy and paste it from here into the email, you may want to edit the font along with your signature before you send it to make it more aesthetically pleasing and professional)


Sales & Marketing Intern

Example first email to sales and marketing intern applicant:

Hi NAME,

Great to hear from you.

Our sales and marketing intern at AgileVentures is unpaid, but we do cover expenses.  We're a UK charity trying to help other charities with their IT and help people around the world skill up in IT and programming.

If you're interested please send me your resume, references and a cover letter and we'll review and get back to you.

Best, (Your NAME) 
```

Example acceptance email to sales and marketing intern applicant:

```
Hi NAME,

Hope you had a good weekend.  Please join our Slack by going to https://www.agileventures.org.

The references that have come in so far are very good - hope we can chat on Slack soon.  I'll invite you into the marketing channel :-)

Best, (Your NAME)
```

Example trial email to sales and marketing intern applicant:

Hi Alex,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  Would you be interested in joining our marketing meeting next Wed at 12:45pm UTC+1 to see if you'd be a good fit for our intern position?

If you're interested let us know.

Best, Sam

Hi NAME,

Sorry for the further delay - we'd love to get you involved.   What's your availability during the week?

Junior Developer
----------------

Example first contact email:

```
Hi NAME,

Great to hear from you.  Please sign up at https://www.agileventures.org if you'd like to pursue this opportunity.  Once you've signed up you'll get an email invite to our Slack chat instance.  There we can talk more about the role and getting your involved with our programming team.

Since we're a charity with a limited budget this is unfortunately an unpaid position.  We can cover expenses, but would be very happy to have you join us as a volunteer junior developer if your background makes you a good fit.  We can give you experience with the latest tech stacks and collaboration with developers from all over the world.

Many thanks in advance
Best regards,
