Hi NAME,

Great to hear from you.

Our sales and marketing intern at AgileVentures is unpaid, but we do cover expenses.  We're a UK charity trying to help other charities with their IT and help people around the world skill up in IT and programming.

If you're interested please send me your resume, references and a cover letter and we'll review and get back to you.

Best, Sam

Hope you had a good weekend.  Please join our Slack by going to https://www.agileventures.org.

The references that have come in so far are very good - hope we can chat on Slack soon.  I'll invite you into the marketing channel :-)

Best, Sam
