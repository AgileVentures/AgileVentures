## Details of Plan Benefits:

### Access to AgileVentures Slack

AgileVentures uses the [Slack](https://slack.com/) instant messaging service to support the coordination of all activities.  Join hundreds of other AgileVentures developers and browse the difference project channels and project notification channels integrated with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/), [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/), to take the pulse of real Agile projects.

### Access to AgileVentures Scrum meetings

AgileVentures runs open scrum meetings around the clock so you can hear about the latest developments on projects, propose new projects and hook up with potential pair partners.


### Project logistics advice and support

AgileVentures mission is to develop quality software for charities and other non-profits whilst also supporting the learning and development of individuals wishing to improve their teamwork and coding skills.  AgileVentures software projects are all open source and open development.  

Any project can become an AgileVentures project given that it meets the following criteria:

- Open Source
- Open Development
- Charitable Objective (as assessed by board of Trustees)

AV mentors will be very happy to draw on their many years of experience working on and supporting open source charity software projects.  Ask in the #new_projects channel on Slack about setting up your new project, or in #project_support for additional help on your existing project

### User experience review of project (HCI)

Senior AV mentors will be happy to provide a complete user experience (UX) review of your project.   See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c1-LMlyaVc) for an example of the kind of review you can receive.  In order to receive your UX review you will need to provide appropriate user story documentation.
