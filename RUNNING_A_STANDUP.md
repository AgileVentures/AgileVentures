Running a Standup (or Scrum Meeting)
-----------------------------------

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Standups (or Scrums) are short meeting that are time capped.  Scrums in AgileVentures are usually 15 minutes.  The key idea is that everybody who is present gets to give a quick update on what they've been doing, anything they are stuck on and their immediate plans.

Nobody likes long meetings, and the job of the Scrum master is to keep the meeting short, and ensure that when longer conversations break out they are moved to the end of the Scrum, or a future meeting.  It is possible to run such a meeting without an explicit Scrum master, with each participant just taking a turn to update on the same set of questions.  Common question sets that participants ask themselves, or are asked by the Scrum master, are as follows:

* What did you do?
* What is blocking you?
* What are your plans?

Or

* What successes have you had?
* What struggles have you had?

Or (more simply)

* How are things going with you?

In AgileVentures we run Scrums online.  Some may be open to all projects, such as the "Kent Beck", "Martin Fowler", PacificRim and "Bob Martin" scrums, while others may be specific to individual projects.  The idea of the "open" scrums is that participants get to hear about activities in other projects, and learn how things operate in the decentralized structure of AgileVentures.  Where possible please start scrums via the [AgileVentures website](http://www.agileventures.org/events):

10 minutes before a scrum is due to go live a "Start a Hangout on Air" button will appear next to the "event actions" dropdown.  Clicking this button will start a Google Hangout, and if everything goes well it will notify several AgileVentures slack channels as well as making the main AgileVentures landing page include a link to the hangout.  

Often, but not always, the person who starts the hangout will also run the Scrum.  It can be a different person, or there might be no explicit host/master; but it often helps to have one person "running" things, particularly if there are new members, or we just want to avoid confusion about who is speaking next, or whether a conversation has run on too long.

The person who started the hangout will also need to click "Start Broadcast" for the hangout to be recorded, and the hangout will stream and be recorded to that person's YouTube account.  The person who started will also have control of which video feed appears in the recording - either auto-switching based on audio, or locked to a particular feed.

In some cases the Google Hangouts API may fail.   The "Start Hangout on Air" button has in the past redirected to a set of instructions about how to start a YouTube Live event.  If you are logged in to a verified YouTube account you can start a YouTube live event directly from the following link:

https://www.youtube.com/my_live_events?action_create_live_event=1

Ensure to select a "Quick" type to get the Hangout on Air.  We recommend using the Chrome browser in order to invite people to the hangout you will need to copy and paste the URL from the hangout window into the AgileVentures event page by selecting the "Event Actions" --> "Edit hangout link" operation:

Once you click save the AgileVentures slack will automatically post a notification about the hangout (with URL to join) into the [#standup_notifications](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/standup_notifications) and [#general](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/general) channels
