Running a Standup (or Scrum Meeting)
-----------------------------------

Standups (or Scrums) are short meeting that are time capped.  Scrums in AgileVentures are usually 15 minutes.  The key idea is that everybody who is present gets to give a quick update on what they've been doing, anything they are stuck on and their immediate plans.

Nobody like long meetings, and the job of the Scrum master is to keep the meeting short, and ensure that when longer conversations break out they are moved to the end of the Scrum, or future meeting.  It is possible to run such a meeting without an explicit Scrum master, with each participant just taking a turn to update on the same set of questions.  Common question sets that participants ask themselves, or are asked by the Scrum master, are as follows:

* What did you do?
* What is blocking you?
* What are your plans?

Or

* What successes have you had?
* What struggles have you had?

Or (more simply)

* How are things going with you?

In AgileVentures we run Scrums online.  Some may be open to all projects, such as the "Kent Beck", "Martin Fowler", PacificRim and "Bob Martin" scrums, while others may be specific to individual projects.  The idea of the "open" scrums is that participants get to hear about activities in other projects, and learn how things operate in the decentralized structure of AgileVentures.

Usually online scrums are run in Google Hangouts, and since from a technical point of view one person has to start the hangout, it often falls to that person to run the Scrum.  It can be a different person, or their can be no explicit host/master; but it often helps to have one person "running" things, particularly if there are new members, or we just want to avoid confusion about who is speaking next, or whether a conversation has run on too long.

The person who started the hangout will also need to click "Start Broadcast" for the hangout to be recorded, and the hangout will stream and be recorded to that person's YouTube account.  The person who started will also have control of which video feed appears in the recording - either auto-switching based on audio, or locked to a particular feed.

In some cases the Google Hangouts API may fail.   The "Start Hangout on Air" button has in the past redirected to a set of instructions about how to start a YouTube Live event.  If you are logged in to a verified YouTube account you can start a YouTube live event directly from the following link:

Ensure to select a "Quick" type to get the Hangout on Air.  We recommend using the Chrome browser as in order to invite people to the hangout you will need to copy and paste the URL from the hangout window into the AgileVentures event page by selecting the "Event Actions" --> "Edit hangout link" operation:

Once you click save the AgileVentures slack will be automatically post a notification about the hangout (with URL to join) into the [#standup_notifications](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/standup_notifications) and [#general](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/general) channels
