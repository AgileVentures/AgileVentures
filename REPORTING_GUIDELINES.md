# Reporting Guidelines

These are the Reporting Guidelines for the [AgileVentures Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/AgileVentures/AgileVentures/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Feel free to email info@agileventures.org.

We recommend that you include a digital copy of what you considered unacceptable behavior, be it a screenshot of a text chat interaction or a video of a pairing session, scrum or other meeting.  If the interaction is on another site such as in GitHub or Pivotal Tracker comments then please do provide a link, but a screenshot is also appreciated in case things are deleted.

Even you do not have a digital copy, please do your best to describe in detail the unacceptable behavior you were subjected to, or that you witnessed.  And of course please feel free to raise other concerns in email and we will do our best to respond as quickly as possible.
