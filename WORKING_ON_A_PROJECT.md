Working on a Project
-----------------

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Once you've reviewed all the open PRs on the project (please ask questions in the PRs for anything that is unclear), the next thing to do is start looking through the project's tracker.  The purpose of looking through the open PRs is to see what's currently being worked on and what parts of the code base are undergoing change.  This is important to know if you're going to contribute effectively to the project.

The details that follow depend somewhat on the particular project and the ticket tracking system they are using.  LocalSupport used [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/742821) like so:

the current column is what people are currently working on:

If you're interested you can hook up with existing work you can reach out to the individuals working on these tickets. The backlog is ordered by priority by the client - so items at the top have priority:

Tickets in the icebox are in a random order and need to be voted on by the team in order to get started:

Anyone can start a vote, and please feel free to ask any question about any ticket either in the project Slack channel or in the pivotal tracker (you need to be added to the tracker so you can add comments)

The most important thing is that we share what we are working on (or thinking about working on) with the rest of the team so we can all coordinate our efforts to be most effective

Project coordinators will also be very happy to help you set up pair programming if you are interested in that :slightly_smiling_face:
