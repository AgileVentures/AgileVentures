## Crowdsourced Learning

**AgileVentures is a project incubator that stimulates and supports development of social innovations, open source and free software. But first and foremost, we are a place for learning and personal development with members from across the world with various levels of competence and experience in software development.**

In order to make learning across distances possible, we have adopted an organizational model that supports distributed software engineering as well as crowdsourced learning - an approach that aims to address the limitations of more traditional learning systems.

Crowdsourced Learning is when two or more people attempt to learn something or gain a better understanding of a specific subject by solving a problem or set of problems together. Crowdsourced Learning is based on the idea that knowledge can be created within a group whose members actively interact by sharing experiences and take on asymmetric roles.

In Crowdsourced Learning, the process is learner-centered rather than teacher-centered and knowledge is viewed as a social construct, facilitated by peer interaction, evaluation and cooperation. Unlike individual learning, members of groups engaged in crowdsourced learning capitalize on each others resources and skills (learners asking one another for information, evaluating one another's ideas, monitoring one another's work, etc.).

Solely acting as a "manager" or "supervisor" is not enough if a group member wants to take an active role as a "driver" in a learning group. An individual that regularly takes on that role in group sessions, must concentrate less on creating a process of instruction or supervision, but more on the process of creating a learning environment. He or she must take on a role as a facilitator and mould, model, and encourage the desired behavior, with other group members being able and willing to adopt the core ideas of crowdsourced learning and participate in group activities regularly.
