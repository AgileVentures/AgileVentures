7 - click the "Start live streaming" button

Note: 

One huge advantage of Jitsy is that unlike a Google hangout, *any* participant can start a recording stream, and new recordings can be re-started after a previous one has finished.  At the moment streaming from a Jitsy appears to be limited to an hour.
