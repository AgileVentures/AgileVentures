## Election of new Trustees
### Who are the candidates
#### Bryan Yap

Bryan is a long time member of AgileVentures, worked on projects including WebsiteOne, Codealia and LocalSupport. Was very active back in the day when he was still learning how to develop software, and his experiences have since landed him a professional job working in software. He is now a lead developer working remotely for a company called Inflowmatix. Always looking for new challenges and ideas, he isn't afraid of testing new technologies such as Elixir, React, GraphQL and Rust.

Being one of the success stories from AgileVentures early days, he strongly believes in our philosophy on bringing up new software developers. He is currently chair of the board of trustees for AgileVentures.

#### Steve Porter

Steve Porter is the CEO of Capable Communities, a Social Enterprise company, and he believes strongly in the capability of voluntary and community groups to achieve positive social change.  He wants to help this process by strengthening groups so they can successfully compete with other sectors, win public sector contracts and deliver on an equal footing with the public sector.  

#### Rachel Wright

Rachel has extensive experience in project coordination and a strong background in developing effective systems and structures within the voluntary and public sector. She's responsible for quality systems, finance, running Disclosure &amp; Barring Services and operational business development.

She is a trustee of a small UK based charity which runs a volunteer-led activity programme in a psychiatric hospital in Romania.

#### James Bore

James find solutions for problems, leaning on existing tooling and expertise as much as possible to solve cybersecurity challenges.

After starting out in network management he meandered for a few years across most of the disciplines in IT, gradually building more of a focus on security as a speciality rather than any single field of technical expertise. He's worked to become a jack of all trades across information technology, and is currently working to be a master of security on top.

James also keep bees, so am used to dealing with large numbers of angry clients and have developed a resistance to their venom. Alongside, in my spare time, James help teachers to deliver cybersecurity and IT knowledge as part of curriculum classes and occasionally run lockpicking or security workshops for various age groups.

## Who can vote

According to the rules all Premium F2F Members are eligible to vote

## How will the vote be recorded

The vote will be organised by the chair of the AGM who will ask the eligible members to approve trustees with an indication of 'yay' or 'nay' in the text chat associated with the event hangout.  In the event of a tie the chair will cast the deciding vote.
