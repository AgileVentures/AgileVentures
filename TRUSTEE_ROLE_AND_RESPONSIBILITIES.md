From our Charity Constitution:

> 12. Functions and duties of charity trustees
					
> The charity trustees shall manage the affairs of the CIO and may for that purpose exercise all the powers of the CIO. It is the duty of each charity trustee:

> (a)  to exercise his or her powers and to perform his or her functions as a trustee of the CIO in the way he or she decides in good faith would be most likely to further the purposes of the CIO; and

> (b)  to exercise, in the performance of those functions, such care and skill as is reasonable in the circumstances having regard in particular to:
					
> (i)  any special knowledge or experience that he or she has or holds himself or herself out as having; and
						
> (ii)  if he or she acts as a charity trustee of the CIO in the course of a business or profession, to any special knowledge or experience that it is reasonable to expect of a person acting in the course of that kind of business or profession.
