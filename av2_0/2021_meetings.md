#### Summer Camp
The intiative involves organizing a training program in web development. The goal is to re-ignite the community and bring back members to Slack, the online sessions and to the newly restarted effort to use Twitch in the context of community outreach. 
It's a 9 weeks long instructor led training, offered to a selected group of 10 students as active participants and streamed on Twitch for other community members and the general public. The curriculum would be based on selected parts of the “Introduction To Programming” and “Web Application Development with ReactJS” offered by Craft Academy as part of their Enterprise courses (valued at €1600 per student).

The format of the Summer Camp would be:
* 9 weeks
* Led by Thomas Ochman and Mike Aono
* Instructor led sessions (1.5 hour) 2 times per week Tuesday and Thursday
* Instructor led support sessions (2 hours) 1 per week on weekends
* Course materials delivered through CA Teachable (branded for AV) 
* Planning using ThisIsCode platform
* 2 training exams and a Final Exam
* Team based Capstone Project with planning, implementation and delivery.
* Certificates issued by Craft Academy and Agile Ventures
* Letter of Recommendation issued by the coaches and Chairman of the Board of Trustees at graduation

**Action points**: Thomas creates a Curriculum and a Teachable course for the Summer Camp as well as draft for the announcement of the application period. 

#### Marketing
As a charity, Agile Ventures is eligible for Google Ad Grants Program and Google for Nonprofits. Historically, the Marketing Team was in charge of the Ad Grants Program. It seems that the team has not had any meetings since September - October last year.
If we want to move on with the Summer Camp and other initiatives, we want to get started with marketing again. 

**Action points**: Mike reaches out to Federico (a member of the Marketing Team) for more details.

**Mike:**I have reached out to Federico and he suggests that we reach out to Sam as he never directly dealt with the Google Ads people, while Sam did and could help with access. The google ads are still active and he still receives monthly invoices as part of the marketing team, with Lara and Sam. I will reachout to Sam in this regard

#### Spring Cleaning
The website needs to be cleaned from a lot of old projects, inactive members, out-dated descriptions of the charity. 

**Members** Send out an email to everyone and make them aware that unless we get a request from them to keep the account active, we will de-activate it at a certain date. 
**Projects** Send out an email to Project Members, and make them aware that unless we get a request from them to keep the project listing on the websote, we will mark it for deletion at a certain date. 

**NOTE** 
- Rose Williams at BU uses the Project Listing section of WSO in her classes.
- All dletions MUST be soft so that we can reinstate member accounts and projects if needed. 

**Action points**: 
- Thomas will reach out to Rose regarding how we can accomodate her in the future. The idea is that her students can still use the Project Listing, but that we remove the projects one the course run is over and the project is no longer actively worked on. 
- The executive team will organize a workshop and go over the descriptions and agree on a time frame for deletion. 

#### LocalSupport/CIC website

The team discussed the situation with the change requests from CIC that came in last week. There is a need to go over the commercial agreement with CIC and who is working on that project. There also seems to be a deadline involved. 
Another matter that is a potential cause of concern, is the lack of documentation regarding the compensation developers are getting for working on paid projects.

The discussion touched upon the future of project work at AV. We all agree that it needs to remain a central part of the charity's work. Working on real projects is the best way to acquire new skills. 

Our past experience shows, however, that there are a lot of challenges with running client projects with groups of volunteers. In the future, we need to build a more professional organization that can take on client work and compete with for-profit consulting houses on the market. For that to happen, we need to set up a team of experienced developers that can serve as Project leads but also provide a set of guidelines and best practices for how AgileVentures work on projects. 
**Action points**: 
- Mike gathers the necessary documentation regarding the project and forwards the materials to Bryan and Thomas. 
- Discuss with Ethan about creating a set of guide lines for how projects are being run and compensated.
