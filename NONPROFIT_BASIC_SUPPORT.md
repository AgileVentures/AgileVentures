# NonProfit Basic Support

Need support for your NonProfit project, website or mobile app.  Take out AgileVentures Basic level NonProfit support and you'll get the following:

- Your project is assigned a designated contact person within AV, who will take on an administrative role in the necessary Platform as a Service (PaaS) systems, e.g. Heroku, Drie, AWS, AppStore, Google Play
- AV administrator will monitor the application
- AV will provide advice to customer regarding ongoing operation, maintenance and so forth
- AV will acknowledge contact requests within two business days
- Basic tier includes 1 "incident" (contact, email exchange regarding a question, etc) per month - the initial "contact" to transfer the app to AV stewardship is included in the membership fee
- Anything beyond the above, including actual help upgrading (Platform as a Service) PaaS or requests to further enhance the app, can be made available but require higher tier support
- Naturally we work hard to ensure satisfaction, but in case of dissatisfaction, AV's liability is strictly limited to refunding the membership fee
