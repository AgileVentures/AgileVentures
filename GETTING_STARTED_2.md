# Getting Started 2 (of 7)

### Step 2

Here's how we communicate and coordinate projects:

- [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) is kept in [Github](https://github.com) repos
- [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) (feature descriptions) are kept in project's [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) (**or other tracking systems, such as** [waffle](https://waffle.io/))
- **other documentation** and detailed **feature descriptions** are kept in project's section on agileventures.org 
- **real time discussion** takes place in [Slack](https://agileventures.slack.com/) channels, in the specific channel for the project (you'll be invited to our Slack on [signup to AV.org](https://www.agileventures.org/users/sign_up))
- **long-term discussions** (where it is important to keep records outside Slack) are done on Pivotal Tracker, or in Github pull requests/issues or by commenting under specific documents in project's section on agileventures.org 
- **optionally recordings of** [PairProgramming](https://www.agileventures.org/pair) **sessions and standups** are stored on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWx5w-DtQEbONmqkpvyVkg). The list of videos for a specific project is under project's section on agileventures.org
- **technical information** on the project is kept in documents under project's section on agileventures.org
