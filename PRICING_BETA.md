# Membership Plans (Original)

AgileVentures helps teams of developers get together to work on open source charity IT projects.  In the [free plan](http://www.agileventures.org/free) developers get project logistics support and the use of AgileVentures slack and hangouts integration for online meetings.

AgileVentures also provides [Premium](http://www.agileventures.org/premium) and [PremiumPlus](http://www.agileventures.org/premiumplus) membership plans with benefits beyond our [free tier membership](http://www.agileventures.org/free). These plans are designed to provide our members with greater support for their professional development as an Agile software developer.  See below for details.

Not trying to level up as an Agile software developer? Sign up for a plan to [sponsor a developer](http://www.agileventures.org/sponsorship) to get the support they can't otherwise afford.
