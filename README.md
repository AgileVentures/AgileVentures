Agile Ventures
===========

For discussion of all those things that are Agile Ventures in general rather than the technology of any project in particular, as well as a place to hold documents on how to get stuff done:

 * [Joining an Existing Project](JOINING_A_PROJECT.md)
 * [Starting a New Project](STARTING_A_NEW_PROJECT.md)
 * [Running a Standup](RUNNING_A_STANDUP.md)
 * [Participating in Asynchronous Voting](ASYNC_VOTING.md)
 * Participating in a Standup (coming soon)
