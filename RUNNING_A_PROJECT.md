Running a Project
-----------------

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

As a project manager you are expected to be available in the Slack channel for your project to answer questions and give support to developers who are contributing to your project or trying to get "onboarded" or "setup" with your project.

We require the following:

* all code related to the project should be stored in open source repositories (e.g. on GitHub) and links to that code prominently displayed in project pages or similar
* where possible all meetings should be run in Google Hangouts and streamed/recorded to YouTube so that all team members can participate or observe.  Please use AV Events to manage this process.
* provide an open to all project tracking board (e.g. Waffle or Pivotal Tracker) that will house tickets with the work that is needed to be done, placed in appropriate columns (e.g. icebox, estimated, ready, in-progress, review and done)
* ...

We recommend the following:

* Provide clear README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md in your open source repo with instructions for installing and getting set up with the project and how to contribute
* Provide a mechanism to vote on tickets whether that it face to face in scrums/meetings in google hangouts, or via voting in the slack channel
* Work should be started on things after a vote (estimate of complexity has taken place)
* There should be at least three people voting on a story, and where possible at least one of those should be a senior developer
* ...
