This document is in its early stages.  We want to capture as many questions and answers as possible.  If you've had a *question* about AgileVentures, or if you can *answer* something, please _do_ edit this document.  If you are not sure if your information duplicates information, just note make a note about that: _"(This may be a duplicate of ...)"_.  If your answer contradicts another answer, please note the contradiction *_and_* *file an issue* so that others are aware of the contradiction and can help to resolve it.



It's not yet clear how to best organize this information.  Make your best guess, and then as more information is added to this document, we'll evaluate and organize things.

This information may later be put into a database and displayed on the AgileVentures site (a.k.a. WebSiteOne (WSO)).  For now, we just want to gather as much information as possible.
