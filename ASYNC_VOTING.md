Async Vote How To
-----------------

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

To start an asynchronous vote on a story, bug fix or chore in a text chat channel, start by identifying a ticket you would like to be estimated in terms of complexity of 1 (simple), 2 (medium) or 3 (hard), e.g. 

https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/132571845

Then post a message like this to the channel:

> @channel :speaking_head_in_silhouette: _New *[ASYNC VOTE]* now on:_ https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/132571845 `ensure that we have good default tags on all pages`. Please DM me with: 1(Simple), 2 (Medium) or 3(Hard) - Discussion in ticket or here as you prefer. :slightly_smiling_face:

Replacing the URL and name of the ticket as appropriate.  If you can, pin this message to the channel, and remove any other pinned votes.

Having done this other members in the channel may discuss and ultimately DM you a vote of 1, 2 or 3.

When you receive a DM vote from someone post a new message in the channel like this:

> @here :speaking_head_in_silhouette: _Update *[ASYNC VOTE]* on:_ https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/132571845 `ensure that we have good default tags on all pages`. 1 vote so far from *[* @tansaku *]* - Discussion in ticket or here as you prefer. :slightly_smiling_face:

include the person's nickname but not their vote.   The idea is that votes are secret until at least three people have voted.  You can speed things up by being the first to vote.  If someone votes before you, you probably should not vote as seeing their vote skews your own estimate.

Once you have received three votes you can reveal the votes by posting a message like so:

> @here :memo: _Results *[ASYNC VOTE]* on:_ https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/132571845 `ensure that we have good default tags on all pages`. *[* @tansaku = 1, @diraulo  = 1 , @edmilsonefs  = 1 *]* - Everyone agrees on this one :slightly_smiling_face:

If everyone agreed then you can just set the agreed estimate - or ask someone who has permissions to do so.  If people did not agree, then prompt discussion like so:

> @here :memo: _Results *[ASYNC VOTE]* on:_ https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/132571845 `ensure that we have good default tags on all pages`. *[* @tansaku = 1, @diraulo  = 2 , @edmilsonefs  = 2 *]* - disagreement, let's discuss

hopefully the group can then come to agreement through discussion in the channel or the ticket itself.  

Note that if no one is voting you may need to post additional reminders - we recommend using @channel again if 24 hours have passed with no vote - you can also DM members individually to ask them to vote if you think they will be interested

Finally, take any discussion that took place in slack and paste into the ticket so we have a record
