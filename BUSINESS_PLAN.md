# Business Plan

## Objective

Provide "in context" learning experiences for everyone around the world through collaborative work on "real" charity, non-profit and socially responsible projects.

## Model

Developers around the world pay for Premium membership to access a number of benefits in their professional development such as receiving expedited code review, mob programming and pair programming sessions depending on payment level.  These mentor services are currently provided by volunteers.

Corporate sponsors pay for visibility on our site and in marketing activities, while some charities and socially responsible organisations pay for contracts to manage project work.

Commitment to transparency means that free tier membership provides significant access to community and involvement in project work.

## Income (as of April 2017)

- Premium Membership (inc. Donor Subscriptions): 800 pounds a month from ~35 individuals
- Corporate Sponsorship: 350 pounds a month
- Contracts: ~ 16,000 pounds (so far 2017)

## Outgoings

- Hosting Services: ~$30 a month
- Insurance: TBD
- Staff costs: TBD

## Risks

- Current model relies heavily on volunteer time
- Competitors specialised on supporting charities OR professional development provide more compelling services

## Opportunities

- Pay for mentors to receive additional training
- Pay mentors explicitly for time mentoring
- Improve onboarding experience to increase numbers signing up for Premium membership (CRM)
- Additional outreach for contracts
- Additional outreach for grants
